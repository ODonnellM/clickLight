# Clicklight.js

Clicklight is a small event driven jQuery plugin that allows images to
be highlighted through the use of HTML 5 image maps and canvasing. By
providing a clean and open API, Clicklight is easy to use and doesn't
get in the way of any project it is built into.

Clicklight was built after being unable to find an equivalently small
plugin that allows images to be used as hooks into a sites
functionality. Focusing only on what this plugin does allows for a
very small footprint while still allowing for endless unique uses to
fit any project.

## Demo's

Coming soon

## Basic usage

Clicklight only expects a fe things to be done prior to
instantiation:
* - an image with an assoicated image map has to be present on the
    page
	
* - the `<img>` tag needs to be wrapped in a `<div>` tag

* - each `<area>` tag to be managed is recquired to have a `data-cl-uid="userSetID"` on it.

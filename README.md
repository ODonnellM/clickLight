# Clicklight.js
##About
Clicklight is a	jQuery plugin developed	for use	with image maps	where highlighting is necessary. Using a simple and modular api, a clicklight instance can hook onto any image with an associated map and immediatley start providing functionality. For those wanting a more customized use case, digging deeper into the plugin through callbacks and overwrites of default behavior is also possible.

##Dependancies
Clicklight has not yet been tested on all browsers but should function without incident on any browser with support for HTML 5's canvasing.

This plugin was built over jQuery 3.1.1. Any issues with other versions will be noted here as issues are discovered.

##Using the plugin
Using clicklight.js is fairly simple in most cases, but can also be built into just about any ecosystem where it's needed. Walking through the more basic functionality of the plugin should give you an idea as to how you can incorporate this open design into your own project
